When the rice is done, spread it into a wide container. Sprinkle the sushi seasoning on top and mix gently with a paddle. (Don't crush the rice!)

Spread one cup of rice onto each nori square, leaving approximately 1cm of non-riced nori on the top.

Spread the wasabi or horseradish across the roll from side to side.
